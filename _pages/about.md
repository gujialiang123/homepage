Hi, I'm **Jialiang Gu (谷嘉良)**, a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at George Mason University, advised by [Prof. Keren Zhou]((https://www.jokeren.tech/)). I also collaborate closely with [Prof. Jialu Zhang](https://jialuzhang.netlify.app/) at the University of Waterloo.

My research interests focus on **machine learning systems (MLSys)** and **LLM applications**, as well as questions around **teaching and learning in the LLM era**. Currently, my work mainly spans three directions: (1) building ecosystem tools for next-generation GPU programming languages such as Triton (e.g., **TileLens**); (2) developing LLM-based tools for code understanding, analysis, and explanation; and (3) enhancing LLM reasoning and reliability with techniques like **static analysis** and **agent-based** methods.

I’m always open to conversations and collaborations around these topics—feel free to reach out.
