Hi, I'm **Jialiang Gu (谷嘉良)**, a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at George Mason University, where I am advised by Prof. Keren Zhou.

My research interests center on the intersection of **machine learning systems (MLSys)** and **natural language processing (NLP)**. I am particularly excited about:

- designing more efficient machine learning systems and algorithms; and
- applying large-scale models to challenging problems that have resisted traditional solutions.

I am always open to conversations and collaborations around these topics, so please feel free to reach out.
